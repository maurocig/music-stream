It's an app that can play music.
We're calling it Tracks.
Looks like Spotify.

This is copyright free music.
we're doing it totally from scratch. nothing to fork or anything.
how do you actually get STARTED?
This course emphasizes on starting.

We have back end and front end in the same application, but the architecture is completely different to having a constantly running server that serves static assets.

now we are using serverless function.
with next.js we get the benefit of running back end code in a front end component.
the lines are going to get blurred. which is a feature of next.js.
